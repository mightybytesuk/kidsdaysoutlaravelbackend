The ArtistThis magnificent steel sculpture was crafted by Antony Gormley. Antony Gormley’s Angel of the North first spread its wings in February 1998 and has been welcoming visitors to Newcastle Gateshead for more than 15 years. At 54m wide and 20m high, it's taller than four double decker buses and with a wingspan as big as a jumbo jet! The Angel of the North is believed to be the largest sculpture of an angel in the world. What is the Angel of the North made of? The 200-tonne sculpture is the largest British sculpture to exist. It can withstand winds of up to 100 miles per hour! It is made of weather resistant Cor-ten steel, containing a small amount of copper, which forms a patina on the surface that mellows with age. It is designed to last for 100 years and it cost  £800,000 to build.  Poetic Meaning of the Angel of the North You don't have to sit in the car to see it either! This awe-inspiring piece of public art is visited by 150,000 people a year and is one of the most famous sculptures in the UK. This contemporary sculpture has sparked a lot of poetic resonance with local poets feeling inspired by the gravity of its presence. Antony Gormley himself, stated that the Angel of the North had lots of poetic resonance in the place it stands. The Angel stands on top of a mound where lots of mining previously took place - mining was a very big part of history and culture in Newcastle & Tyne and Wear. Mining dominated the region's coal exporting trade for centuries and local people worked as miners, so it was a very big part the North East's history.  How do I get there? If you want to see the enormous Angel in person then there are a number of bus routes you can take. The Go North East bus The Angel (number 21) departs from Newcastle Eldon Square Bus Station and Gateshead Interchange every 8 minutes.

  
        
          
          
        
    

The bus stops on Durham Road near to the Angel of the North and the stop for the return journey is only a short walk away on the opposite side of the road.The journey takes about 20 minutes from Newcastle and 10 minutes from Gateshead Interchange. The fares to the Angel of the North from Newcastle are £2.10 for a single and £3.90 for a return. Buy your tickets from the bus driver (just like any other bus).  Events The Angel of the North is free to visit 24 hours a day! There are not really any events that take place around the famous sculpture but once every now and then, someone will take on the challenge of decorating the angel. For example in 1998 Kevin Waugh and a group of men decided the newly erected Angel of the North needed a little something extra... They dressed the angel in the famous footballer, Alan Shearer's, number nine shirt! this stunt made the BBC news and Antony Gormley himself was impressed.  The Angel of the North is a must-see on a visit to Newcastle Gateshead with your family. Whether you are local to the famous Angel or you are on a short break, it's the perfect Instagram & TikTok opportunity for you kids! Or if you simply drive down the A1, you're kids will love the breath-taking views that the Angel offers.","Durham Road, Low Eighton,

The unusually high metallic deposits in the soil have led to rare specimens of plant and lichen which are interesting to identify, leading to the site being an acknowledged Site Of Special Scientific Importance plus the industrial remains include atmospheric mine entrances and vintage buildings so it's a feast for a kids' imagination. One of the outbuildings features a small museum with interpretive displays on local geological history, plus there are numerous trails and paths intersecting the surrounding grounds to explore. 90 minute guided tours through the mine itself are available on the special open days and well worth doing but it should be noted that these are few and far between, so plan (and book!) ahead. Membership is worth consideration too as it gains you access to additional events.","Nenthead,

They'll guide you over to the island where you can view up to a whopping forty thousand nesting sea birds including the Sandwich, Common and considerably rarer Roseate Terns; Eider Ducks; Kittiwakes; and Puffins! So, it's well worth taking binoculars, especially seeing as on the eastern side of the island you can also find the resident Grey Seal colony and observe their playful antics. A joyful trip in almost all weathers, your whole family will find this a refreshing and inspiring experience. Your vessel will either be the classic G Fisher vessel or the RNLB Beryl Tollemache which is a restored ex life boat. Either way there's plenty of fascinating little details about the boats to learn if you can twist the kids toward the educational side instead of watching for otters.

Their new Pony Club Centre is a popular addition to Pockerley where children and youngsters (aged 5 to 21 years old) are encouraged to learn about the caring and practical side of horse and pony care alongside their riding experiences. Achievement badges, awards and practical exams are run throughout the Pony Club season, which is March through October, and Pony Club camps are organised regularly in July and August too for a more immersive learning experience. There are 2 large outdoor arenas for teaching purposes, a smaller open arena (20m x 40m) and a larger open arena (30m x 50m), the latter of which also serves as a show jumping area and has a good selection of show jumps to show off on! All arenas are of high standard with all weather surfaces and are also floodlit. The larger arena has a fitted microphone system for mass communication and there is also a small cross country course on site! As well as these on-site facilities, there are plenty of opportunities to hack and trek through the beautiful, local countryside on their well mannered mounts. A small coffee shop is situated on the premises and this provides viewing for both arenas, ideal for proud parents spectating. And it is all easily accessible from the A1 and approx 1 mile from the famous Beamish museum which is well worth a visit too!","Pockerley Buildings Farm, Beamish,

Either way, at Warkworth Castle you can recreate your wildest imaginations, stepping back through a portal to Medieval England - more specifically Northumberland.  The Medieval CastlePerched upon a hill, surrounded by daffodils, Warkworth Castle is one of the most beautiful castles in the country. Explore ancient staircases, embark on a lovely walk along the riverside and take a boat trip to the Warkworth Castle Hermitage - we recommend getting tickets for both of these things! Enjoy the peaceful setting of this hidden gem, which was probably built as a private chapel for the 1st Earl of Northumberland.

Warkworth Castle and Hermitage form one of the most unusual pairs of ancient monuments in Britain. The castle was probably laid out in its present form in about 1200 and was the favoured residence of the powerful Percy family from the 14th to the 17th centuries.

Warkworth Castle is a well-documented example of a 12th century tower keep castle which developed from an earlier motte and bailey castle and remained in use till the end of the 16th century.The Castle is just a 10 minute walk from the active village, where you can explore  Unearth the family history of the Percy's Ever wondered how the other half lived - and by half I mean over half a century ago!

Managed to get to the top? Oversee the spectacular river and coastal views from the castle walls, as if you were one of the Percy's. 

Visit the Northumberland Tower while you're here! The great tower or keep is almost complete today despite being built by the first Earl of Northumberland over 600 years ago! Curious why? Warkworth was besieged by the Scots in 1327 and played a key role in the long-running war between England and Scotland. Things to do:- Knights Tournament Transport yourselves back to Anglo-Saxon times in the Knights Tournament.

It was rebuilt in the 17th century and still has some really impressive woodwork from that time, so be sure to take a look.
 The museum has a garden, which used to be the churchyard and contains two sculptures by a well known local artist, which are definitely worth checking out.
 There are displays full of fascinating objects that depict the origins of the city and how it grew over time and illustrate industries, lost trades and the life of the people.
 There is a great model of the city during medieval times, a Crime and Punishment section with a Victorian prison cell, and some beautiful backlit stained glass windows to wonder at.
 You can compare a model of Durham' marketplace in the 1830s with a photograph of it after it was rebuilt in Victorian times and spot the differences. Don't miss the ‘death chair' in the schools section or the chance to have a go at some brass rubbing with the kids!","St Mary Le Bow, North Bailey,

 The Museum is housed in an historic 17th century building on the harbourside Walker's House where the young James Cook lodged as apprentice to Captain John Walker in 1746, then a youth aged 17. This is the sole surviving building that can with absolute certainty be connected to Cook! The charmingly authentic rooms are furnished according to an inventory made in the early 1750s and you can visit the attic where he slept alongside the other apprentices which is now also used as the space for their annual special exhibitions. During November through February, there is generally no special exhibition in Cook's Attic and some refurbishment may often be in progress so time your visit for spring or summer to get the most from your visit.
 There is a great selection of model ships associated woth Cook including purportedly his favourite: The Resolution. This is the most popular model with children as every member of the crew and every item on board are set aside in miniature grouped according to purpose: fascinating! 
 You can also check out a collection of his personal correspondences plus the various works of the artists he took on board on his travels in the South Seas.","Grape Lane,

 The Trail booklet sets the scene…a dastardly crime has been committed, and whilst you follow the set of clear directions taking in the best scenic and historical sights of Alnwick, you and the kids will need to keep your eyes peeled in order to answer the clues which will help eliminate the suspects until you are left with whodunit!
 Answers can be found on anything we can write a crafty clue on, such as an engraving on a building, the numbers on statue, a plaque or monument.
 Great for all working together as a family, the Trail will take around 1.5 hours to complete, but as it is self guided, it can be done in your own time. The Trail involves 1 miles of walking, but the kids wont even realise they are getting some exercise as they will be having too much fun!

 Exclusive member offer: Free Fairy Door Hunt - become a member now! Tour the lit caves safely with kids and explore the ancient rock features close up: an awe inspiring geological experience that'll have the kids turning into rockhounds if only for the duration. After they have toured, visitors are welcomed to sit and watch the 20 minute presentation in their little theatre which is all about the creation of the caves.

Pushchairs and baby back carriers are not permitted due to restricted access. Helmets are provided for your safety and must be worn at all times. Access to the cave is via 65 steps, so although there are hand rails on both sides those with limited mobility or teeny tiny legs need to give it due consideration!","Greenhow Hill, Pateley Bridge,

You can explore the atmospheric remains of the King's tower and check out the displays in the Courthouse Museum, nice and educational but so interesting the kids will barely notice they're learning! Download one of their audio guides for adults or children and take a semi guided tour of the castle to get the full experience: you can be transported back in time to hear how the site would have looked in the Middle Ages and discover what castle life was really like including some (non grisly) details about the dungeon! Listen to tales of the grand chamber and hear royal residents greet their guests, see some Medieval graffiti, discover a secret underground tunnel and find out about the fate of the castle during and after the Civil War! As well as visiting the Castle and Museum, afterwards you can hire some equipment and enjoy the Castle Grounds with a few family tournaments of Putting and Bowls! An extra element of fun for the trip so long as you've got the weather for it. The Castle site is generally accessible for wheel and pushchairs but there's pretty limited access to the historic buildings so be prepared to carry the small ones and take a munchkin carrier if you can. The ground floor of the King's Tower is on a single level, but access to the dungeon and King's Chambers are down steep and worn stairs, so again the little ones may struggle and it bears some planning. Knaresborough town is a just short walk away from the castle where you can explore the riverside and see what else you can find along the charming cobbled streets. Lovely!","Castle Yard,

In the 1820s the prison relinquished its function and prisoners were split between the nearby Morpeth Gaol and the Hexham House of Correction, but it was sympathetically refurbished in 1980 and its current incarnation is a fascinating family oriented museum dedicated to the deep and specific history of the building and it's itinerary of punishments, including branding, banishment, pillory and stocks! Great for kids of school age and interesting for everyone in the family as well as being a lovely perspective check for kids on why they should bloomin' well behave when asked nicely!

Make sure your eyes are taking in every single detail during your time at The Forbidden Corner. Noticed anything odd about the walls? What if we told you there were legs sticking out of one wall and an eye beautifully carved into the other? There are also streams that weave throughout the garden too which may contain a goblin or two...

Welcome to The Plotters’ Forest, a bespoke children’s play area that’s north of Raby Castle nestled in a magical Christmas tree plantation. Built around existing trees and natural clearings with sustainable materials, the play equipment feels woven into the forest; an extension of the great outdoors. Enjoy incredible activities from stargazing decks to climbing towers and tunnels, high-level walkways and three-storey forts in the forest. A truly magical space that offers an imaginative playground for all ages to enjoy. Discover your inner rebel.


In Potter’s Paradise, you can enter through a towering gateway and disappear into the dense woodland. Explore ground-level forest trails, climb high walkways and towers and become part of a magical mischievous world. You can also create a cacophony of outdoor musical instruments and match pairs on our giant memory game, or strike a Plotters’ Portrait pose and cause chaos with our spinning signposts. Visitors young and old will love getting lost amongst stunning views, impressive sky-high turrets and treetop tunnels, before spreading out on stargazing decks and slipping down slides. Send your fellow plotters coded messages through the Talking Tubes, and spot enemies in the Mischief Mirrors. And for the very smallest rebels, there’s a dedicated toddler area, like mini turrets, climbing equipment, slides and a chalkboard for drawing secret squiggles.


For centuries, Raby Castle has been home to men and women who stood up for their beliefs and changed the course of history; plus those who weren’t so lucky and ended up in big trouble. Which will you prove to be: a Plucky Plotter or a Rotten Rebel? Find out in The Plotters’ Forest. There’s also a 200 acre Deer Park, for everyone to enjoy exploring the ancient landscape, lush parkland and can also spot some red and fallow deer while they graze! After all, that exhilarating fun, replenish your energy with some coffee, cake, ice cream and plenty more at the Plotters’ Pantry. Overlooking the toddlers’ play area and ample amounts of fresh sandwiches and traybakes. Yummy. Or bring your own picnic and munch outside the yurt café.

All set within a 9,000 square foot site that charmingly recreates the mood of the land that time forgot! Get your putters at the ready and keep your game face on as you sneak past 10 life size dinosaurs who guard the course! The Brachiosaurus and the Spinosaurus are easy to spot, they're ones who are moving… eek! With tropical plants and palm trees, convincing boulders and an actual waterfall, this is a great place to take kids whether they like golf or not! They will though because the course is simple to play and pleasing to the eye - though of course one eye had better be kept on that Spinosaurus… And if you're tough enough for dinosaurs you're tough enough for a bit of drizzle: don't let the weather put you off! Although they'll have to close if it gets too horrible you can even access the Encounter throughout the winter: Saturday, Sunday, Bank and School holidays from 10:00 to 17:00! But it's always worth phoning in to check first if it's wet. And whenever you go, go early - because a second round on the same day is half price!

Although, in 1957 the castle was demolished and only the outer walls were left. The gardens grew wild and the castle remained empty. Nowadays, visitors love to visit Lowther Castle & Gardens. To learn more about the history of Lowther Castle and explore the wild gardens, dramatic ruins and a fabulous adventure playground.

Lowther Castle RuinsThe same family has resided here since 1150, with buildings having come and gone. With the castle's fate sealed in stone in 1957 where James Lonsdale the 7th Earl removed the roof, chimney pot, door handles, fireplace and everything inside to be sold. Due to the war-time requisition. 

Lowther Castle's Historic GardensThe beauty of Lowther Castle is reflected in its 130-acre garden. Where you can explore the past and present. Having been laid out in the 17th century by Sir John Lowther. As well as The Great Yew Avenue and Knot Gardens which were where fruit and veggies were grown for the Lowther Hall kitchens!

If you explore, you'll find the Roman Baths and stone columns that remind you of a by-gone era - the Victorian period. Where you would have found Rock, Japanese, Sweet-Scented and Iris Gardens, all from the early Edwardian period. This was because the Yellow Earl liked to keep up with the latest in horticulture trends! But he emptied the family fortune, as the castle and gardens fell to disarray. After it was stripped in the 1950s, the vast space was then used for commercial chickens and a pig farm.

But in 2008 the castle and gardens were saved and have become a fantastic attraction. With hornbeam sentinels, woolly grasses, clipped yews and an array of botanical flora. The Rose Garden which was inspired by Sleeping Beauty and planted in the shape of an English Rose is a beautiful addition to the imaginative garden. There are also summerhouses, tree hives for wild bees, wildflower meadows and a gorgeous woodland with woodland paths that all reside here. Spanning across the 130-acre garden.  It's also the ideal visitor attraction to view the Lowther Valley and the Lake District mountains.

The permanent exhibitions are pretty disparate and so offer educational entertainment in a wide range of interests and fields of study, with most related back to the region itself for a nice local focus. The more self-explanatory sections include 20th Century Woman, Town In Time, H20 and Art Pottery. Alongside these you can also explore a gallery dedicated to the Lordship of Acklam Plan which is an incredibly large and detailed map; The Nelson Room which pertains to an ornithologist of that name (rather than the Admiral) and offers huge egg and mounted bird collections; and the Four Corners gallery which showcases their original artefact collections and celebrates the museum's growth form a simple natural history museum to the intellectual extravaganza it is today. It should be mentioned to kids ahead of time that the final gallery Earth In Space is more a study of galactic perspective through looking at earthly materials than it is any kind of outer space experience. Additional facilities available here include resources room and education suite for groups, plus a cafe with loos and baby changing room alongside. There are also lockers available in the reception area so if you've got young kids and you're toting tonnes of stuff, there's a handy repository to give you a break from that while you're exploring.","Linthorpe Road,

Try and spot Richard's boar emblem carved above a window in the inner ward or visit the 'sensory garden' of scented plants and tactile objects, great for children and even better for those with sensory impairments. You're welcome to picnic in the grounds, with particularly good spots being on the benches in the formal garden, or at the top of the hill with great views that make great family photo backdrops. Kites and ball games are allowed out here too as long as the kids are considerate of others using the space. With fantastic views over the Tees Gorge this fortress sits on the fringe of an attractive working market town also known as Barney, so there is plenty more locally to explore for families on a day out.

The older kids have access to two linked frames so there are absolutely tons of features to get to grips with and plenty of space to do it in. The toddler area is actually at least the same size as the secondary main frame so they have more room than usual and proper stepped levels. Awesome!

 The charming town of Whitley Bay features a truly old fashioned style sea front with it's elderly dome, family fairground sites, infant paddling pools and friendly boating lakes: it's not a thrill a minute but it's wholesome and simple and perfect for youngsters if not for teens.
 The sand and rock beach to the north of the parade is long and lovely and provided in nice proportions to support hardcore sand sculpting and castling. Those with the urge to ramble can walk across the scenic causeway to St Mary's Island and visit the gleaming white lighthouse! The island is now a visitor centre and nature reserve and you can climb to the top of the decommissioned lighthouse for some spectacular views of the coastline or search the rock pools below for the prolific crabs and mini sea life. So be sure to take a net and bucket along or you'll up doing in your hat again to stop the pleading. We've all been there!
 Dangerous swimming areas are well marked; for the safest and all round best bathing head due south through the town to Cullercoats Bay, a sandier cove between stone piers, where the waves are considered very safe indeed. Lifeguard cover is May to September with an old Victorian lifeboat house that's worth having a look at. Sea kayaking and surfing are popular, with local sources for equipment apparently signposted. A modest mini golf course is apparently nearby according to feedback so that's worth looking out for!
